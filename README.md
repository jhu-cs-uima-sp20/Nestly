So far, we have completed account creation, logging into an existing account, and basic navigation of the app. Once logged in, the user can see a grid view of all profiles that aren't their's. They can expand other people's profiles or view their own. The log out tab is functional. Profile entries are stored in a list in FireBase, uniquely identified by their email.

We have not implemented the favorites tab or delete account. Grid view sorting is for next sprint.
