## Notes on Git

### Preparing to work on the project

The very first thing you want to do as soon as you open the project is pull the latest version by typing in the command line:

`git pull`

When working, edit the code on a different branch. Create a new branch by:

`git checkout -b "new_branch"`

Check which branch you're on by:

`git branch`

After you've made your edits, add, commit, then push your changes to your branch:

`git add .`
`git commit -m "some commit message"`
`git push`

Go to Github, click on the branches page, and open a new pull request for your branch. Request review from the other 3 team members and notify them on Messenger. After they have given the go, merge the branch into the master branch.
