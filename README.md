For sprint 2, we first fully implemented storing user data on Firebase.
Then, we added hiding accounts, blocking users, and deleting an account.
Favorites can be added and removed from the favorites tab. The logged in
user's profile can be edited, including storing a profile picture.

(If there are any issues compiling at first, it may help to 
invalidate cache / build clean before running.)
